In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management and object lifecycles, specifically with regard to delegate patterns and strong references.  Consider a scenario where a view controller (ViewControllerA) sets itself as the delegate of another object (MyObject).  If ViewControllerA retains MyObject strongly (e.g., using `strong` property), and MyObject maintains a strong reference to its delegate (ViewControllerA), a retain cycle is formed.  This prevents either object from being deallocated, even after ViewControllerA is dismissed or no longer needed, leading to memory leaks.
